            Generative artificial intelligence has seen an incredible popularity
            surge in 2022. Big Think has called it ‘the technology of the year’,
            and judging from the amount of attention and VC support generative
            AI startups have been gaining this year, this claim is more than
            justified. Moreover, tech experts say that in the next few years,
            not only will the development of generative AI not slow down but
            will also rapidly increase, conquering new and new fields. In this
            post, written in collaboration with Serokell’s AI developers, I’ll
            take a closer look at what generative AI is and how it works, as
            well as outline common use cases and perspectives for the future.
